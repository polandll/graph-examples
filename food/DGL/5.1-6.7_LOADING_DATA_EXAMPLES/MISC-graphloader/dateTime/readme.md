## Date and Time data type test
This mapping script is currently not working. It seems to believe that the schema must be different than the schema pre-loaded before running
graphloader. 
* [Mapping script] (dateTimeMap.groovy)
* [schema] (schema.groovy)
* [graphloader script] (runDGL.sh)
* [person.csv] (person.csv)
* [personEdges.csv - edges] (personEdges.csv)
* [Queries for Date and Time] (dateTime-queries.groovy)
