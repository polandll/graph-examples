##DataStax Graph##

DataStax Graph has been redesigned for more versatility in application development. Three methods of data model schema creation now exist, each equally capable. Which method you use depends on your skillset and preferences. The methods are:
- Use Gremlin exclusively to create a graph and schema and query the graph.
- Use Cassandra Query Language (CQL) to create a graph and schema that can be queried with Gremlin.
- Convert data stored in Cassandra to create a graph and schema that can be queried with Gremlin.

###This Studio notebook shows the first method, using Gremlin to create a graph and schema.###

See other Studio notebooks for the other two methods.
