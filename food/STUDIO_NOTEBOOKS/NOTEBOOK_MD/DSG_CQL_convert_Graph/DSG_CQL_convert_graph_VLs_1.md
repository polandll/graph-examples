Each vertex label must include at least one property that is used as the partition key. Composite partition keys are defined in the _PRIMARY KEY_ in the CQL table schema. Additionally, a property or properties that will be used as a clustering key or keys can be defined in the _PRIMARY KEY_. Finally, any additional properties that are not part of the partition key or clustering keys are specified along with the property data type.
