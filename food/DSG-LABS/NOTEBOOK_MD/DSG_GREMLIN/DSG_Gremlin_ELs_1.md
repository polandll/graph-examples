For edge labels, the edge label name is included, as well as the originating vertex label _from()_ and the ending vertex label _to()_. Edge properties can be defined similarly to vertex labels, with _property('propName', dataType)_. The corresponding CQL table name is automatically generated from the vertex and edge labels.

See the All Food Schema notebook for a wider variety of edge labels.
