Unfortunately workarounds fail because the POST to the token endpoint fails because there is no `redirect_uri` provided. According to the [OAuth2 docs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3)  this should be a required parameter, but in the FamilySearch docs this wasn't mentioned.\r\n\r\nCan you please add the `redirect_uri` to the token endpoint?

This commit rewrites nyc's mapping logic to use a helper function adapted from remap-istanbul. See <https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/blob/30b67ad3f24ba7e0da8b8888d5a7c3c8480d48b2/lib/remap.js#L55:L108>\r\nfor the original.\r\n\r\nFixes #67.\r\n\r\n@bcoe `remap-istanbul` is [BSD licensed](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/blob/30b67ad3f24ba7e0da8b8888d5a7c3c8480d48b2/LICENSE). Not quite sure what attribution is required in the source code for copying their function.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that including the [\"skip\" annotation](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/blob/30b67ad3f24ba7e0da8b8888d5a7c3c8480d48b2/lib/remap.js#L105) in nyc's existing logic is sufficient. Here's where I have to confess I have no clue how the source map format actually works :wink:\r\n\r\nRegardless it seems like `remap-istanbul`'s logic is stronger (though in other places overly so). Unfortunately the package as a whole does too much to be hooked into nyc, and the remapping logic is tightly coupled with retrieving source maps so it can't be used directly."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/nyc/issues/comments/164598938","html_url":"https://github.com/bcoe/nyc/pull/92#issuecomment-164598938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/nyc/issues/92","id":164598938,"user":{"login":"jamestalmage","id":4082216,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4082216?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage","html_url":"https://github.com/jamestalmage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamestalmage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T00:00:10Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T00:00:10Z","body":"@novemberborn I am done merging all my changes.\r\nThis LGTM, I vote for a merge as soon as you rebase."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-12-15T00:00:10Z"}

As quickfix now - only for scala repl, maybe will be made more general in future.\n\nFix consist of two parts: java part with runner and python part for scala repl task.\nThis is java part.\n\nPR: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/2646\nPython RB: https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/3195/\n\nTesting Done:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/ttim/pants/builds/94068015\n\nBugs closed: 2646\n\nReviewed at https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/3194/","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/digwanderlust/pants/commits/d1f66bfbb0c25e9e8978982ded15d313e5b61955"},{"sha":"205ffd0cedd608ce7316ffb79260f2823fc44c8f","author":{"email":"stuhood@gmail.com","name":"Stu Hood"},"message":"pants build committing publish data for push of org.pantsbuild#pants-runner;0.0.1\n# Prevent Travis-CI from running for this automated jar publish commit:\n#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/how-to-skip-a-build/\n[ci skip]","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/digwanderlust/pants/commits/205ffd0cedd608ce7316ffb79260f2823fc44c8f"},{"sha":"b8f3c70f9243687f74a7cb8b3b4e67021af35b62","author":{"email":"stuhood@gmail.com","name":"Stu Hood"},"message":"pants build committing publish data for push of org.pantsbuild#zinc-sbt-compiler-javac_2.10;0.0.1\n# Prevent Travis-CI from running for this automated jar publish commit:\n#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/how-to-skip-a-build/\n[ci skip]","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/digwanderlust/pants/commits/b8f3c70f9243687f74a7cb8b3b4e67021af35b62"},{"sha":"7d4bbe58b62e52bc27e09decdb410fd8959a8630","author":{"email":"stuhood@gmail.com","name":"Stu Hood"},"message":"pants build committing publish data for push of org.pantsbuild#zinc-sbt-inc_2.10;0.0.1\n# Prevent Travis-CI from running for this automated jar publish commit:\n#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/how-to-skip-a-build/\n[ci skip]","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/digwanderlust/pants/commits/7d4bbe58b62e52bc27e09decdb410fd8959a8630"},{"sha":"28664b62b90f31e2bf4e0b52f1dcbd7fa57d6dea","author":{"email":"stuhood@gmail.com","name":"Stu Hood"},"message":"pants build committing publish data for push of org.pantsbuild#zinc-logging_2.10;0.0.1\n# Prevent Travis-CI from running for this automated jar publish commit:\n#   http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/how-to-skip-a-build/\n[ci skip]","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/digwanderlust/pants/commits/28664b62b90f31e2bf4e0b52f1dcbd7fa57d6dea"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-12-15T00:00:16Z"}

to reproduce:\r\n\r\n0) Make sure the file `standard.lean` is *not* opened in a buffer in Emacs\r\n1) Create a file `test.lean` in the `library` folder, containing\r\n```lean\r\nvariable P : nat → Type\r\n\r\nexample : P (nat.of_num 1000) :=\r\nbegin\r\n  esimp [nat.of_num]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n2) In Emacs, move your point over `end` so that the `*Flycheck Error Messages*` buffer is shown.\r\n3) Try to open `standard.lean` using `C-x C-f standard.lean`.\r\nResult: The buffer `standard.lean` is opened, but the current buffer has not changed to `standard.lean` (it is still `test.lean`)\r\n4) Executing `C-x C-f standard.lean` again works as expected, because `standard.lean` is now open.\r\n\r\n(The fact that you open a `.lean`/`.hlean` file seems to matter, opening other files seems to work normally).\r\n\r\nJakob and I noticed this behavior already for a while, but we couldn't consistently reproduce it

They've helped me out quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm currently trying to build on these techniques; specifically, I'd like to use a `VerticalGridFragment` as the content view of a `BrowseFragment` (instead of a `RowsFragment`). I've got it mostly working, but there are a few strange behaviours that I haven't been able to get around. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue at this point is that the animation of the `rows_container` doesn't appear to work correctly. If the right-most grid item is focused, and the drawer is opened, the `rows_container` does not slide right, instead its width seems to shrink, and the drawer slides over-top. \r\n\r\nWould you be able to provide any insight into what could be happening?

This is not something we plan to use anywhere directly, it's just an experiment to learn from for future deXULification. In any event, we thought it would be good to see how far Servo is from being able to load it. @bgrins has been working in the [servo-client][2] branch to tweak things as necessary to get something loading in Servo.\r\n\r\nThe current state seems to be that `contentWindow` is null inside the various iframes the page tries to load, causing the startup process to fail. When talking with @Ms2ger, it sounds like the iframe implementation is not yet done / complete, which could be why we see this behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to try the experiment locally, I would suggest using Firefox as the DevTools server, and only testing the client UI in Servo to focus on this issue only. The repo's README.md explains how to get started and start a server in Firefox.

AND it worked until a couple of days ago(!)\r\n\r\nI don't know what I changed, but to save my sanity, I created a brand new project, installed the Owin.Selfhost package, IdentityServer3, and MR, and it all works except when I want to use two factor and HttpContext.Current is null.\r\n\r\nIt all works fine hosted on IIS, of course, but I really rely on the self hosted app for dev.\r\n\r\nI've exhausted all other options - I can't see anything on the issues about this. Have I forgotten something crucial? \r\n\r\nThanks Brock.\r\n\r\nps.

Still doesn't support Python 3 and hasn't given any love to PyPI for almost 4 years. It seems impossible to get in contact with the creator. This PR removes the reference of `Flask-Uploads` from the docs. Another option would be to have a NOTE about it being abandoned. I think it also makes sense to remove it from the [Flask extensions list](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) (where's the repo for that?)\r\n\r\n[Here's a 2 year old ticket on Bitbucket that fixes Python 3 support](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-request/5/modernizing/diff). No reply what-so-ever from @leafstorm. His last public activity on Bitbucket was three years ago.\r\n\r\nI'll e-mail him with a reference to this ticket to see if we can get a reply. Perhaps with this ticket we can get the project owner's attention.\r\n\r\nThe best alternative would of course be to get development going on the project again, perhaps by adding more contributors to the project.

I don't know what broke it, but its up and running and there is no more garbage in the console log.  I'd run through any other page the map is on and double check to make sure its not broken.   I switched from using the static maps api to the regular maps api.  Also there is likely some issue with how we are compiling and caching our assets because I had to clobber all of them to make sure cached js files didn't continue being called.  Also right now I am using my API key, I don't know if Crisis Cleanup has their own.  Switch it out in the plugins/google.js file.  which we should also consider git ignoring since the key is visible. \r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aarontitus/crisiscleanup/issues/comments/164599187","html_url":"https://github.com/aarontitus/crisiscleanup/pull/58#issuecomment-164599187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aarontitus/crisiscleanup/issues/58","id":164599187,"user":{"login":"dmehrotra","id":5003523,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5003523?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra","html_url":"https://github.com/dmehrotra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmehrotra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T00:01:41Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T00:01:41Z","body":"Hey Aaron if crisis cleanup has a Gmail account I'd log in with that and\nthen head to developers.google.com you can get an api key there.
